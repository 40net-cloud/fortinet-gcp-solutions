# This configuration will deploy a pair of Fortigates in version 6.4.1 in a High Availability 
# Active-Passive cluster with SDN Connector-based failover
# Protected (internal) and external networks are created in configuration and passed to the template
# Template will create 2 additional VPCs for management and HA internal traffic

outputs:
- name: Master Fortigate Management IP
  value: $(ref.fortigate-cluster.FGT1-mgmt-ip)
- name: Secondary Fortigate Management IP
  value: $(ref.fortigate-cluster.FGT2-mgmt-ip)

- name: Service Public IP (port1)
  value: $(ref.fortigate-cluster.Public_IP)


# Note2:
# you probably noticed redundancy in this file (same data typed multiple times).
# It's a bad practice and leads to problems. In production deployment you'd
# rather create additional "top level" template (jinja) file, which can use
# variables and reuse them.
