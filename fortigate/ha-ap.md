# Active-Passive HA Fortigate cluster with SDN Connector
This template deploys a standard A-P HA cluster of 2 Fortigate instances. This architecture is suitable for deployments where a single Public IP is needed.

## Failover automation
Deployed Fortigates integrate with GCP fabric using an SDN Connector. Upon failover 2 actions are performed:
- named route is switched to the IP of the now active node
- named external IP is re-assigned to the now active node

## Dependencies
This template uses helpers in utils directory.
