# This configuration will deploy a High Availability Active-Passive cluster
# with SDN Connector-based failover and a single IP directly attached to FGT.
# By default it wil luse PAYG images.

# 2 Sample VPC Networks are created before deploying the fortigate cluster
# the other 2 (hasync and mgmt) will be created by the template with default names and CIDRs.

# All resource names will be prefixed with the deployment name.
