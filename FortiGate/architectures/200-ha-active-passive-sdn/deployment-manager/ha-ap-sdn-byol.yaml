# This configuration will deploy a High Availability Active-Passive cluster
# with SDN Connector-based failover and a single IP directly attached to FGT.

# 4 Sample VPC Networks are created before deploying the fortigate cluster

# Replace paths to license1.lic and license2.lic with your real license files

# All resource names will be prefixed with the deployment name.
